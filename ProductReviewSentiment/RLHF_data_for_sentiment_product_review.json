Baldwin and Bassinger seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases. Action wise, the robbery scene in the Pekinpah version was about 100 times more exciting and suspenseful than anything in this re-make.",

As was indiciated to me today by the testing center, these books are designed to refresh the memories of people who have a good knowledge base of the subject. For individuals such as myself, who haven't taken American History since the early 90's, it didn't prepare me like I expected it to.I studied this book for three months, I had a 95% on each of the practice exams, and I barely passed this CLEP. Passing is passing, I agree, but just keep in mind that this book is a framework. There were so many questions on my exam on topics my clep book didn't touch on. Good thing I like the History channel.Anyway, good refresher, but maybe it's wise to supplement with a cheap high school/college text to be safe.",

If you need to raise the curved piece, a piece of 3/4\" white PVC tubing slides right over the tubes with enough support for the top piece and the shower head, without throwing off the tripod balance too badly.Also, on first assembly, we found how poorly the curved piece at the top was welded to the supporting upright; it came off in my hands with very little pressure applied (the other reason why the PVC sleeve became necessary; I have no welding facilities, and didn't think solder would be as strong as I needed.)It looks good in principle, but the low height and cheap manufacture work against it in my books.",

The bottom pad has a slight lip that curls up which I found has caught some crumbs from my daughter's snacking. With small children, crumbs are invitable but it was nice to see that the seat protector caught some of the crumbs too. My 9 month old son is still rear facing but using the softer seat protectors which flop down at his feet. If I had it all do over again, I would have purchased this from the beginning.",

I was a little disappointed with the end, as I was with the end of Fight Club, but I couldn't come up with a better solution. I loved the ghetto lifestyle of Misty and her family, because it's much more real than what most other books try to display as the \"typical family\". I also was fascinated by the character of Peter and his dirty little secret. I have to say, this is the only book where I actually despised the daughter, Tabby! Urgh! Seriously though, at least check this book out of the library and give it a try, I think it will be worth your time!",

I thought this switch looked a lot better and the quiet operation sounded great also so I purchased it.

My configuration only has a 3-wire setup and without the neutral wire, the timer won't work. One of my friend's is an electrician so I called him and he said that generally only timers for HVAC systems in residential building have a neutral wire setup. So before you order, verify that your existing setup has a neutral wire, because it probably does not.",

She ends up temping while writing a \"trials and tribulations\" (read \"sex\") column in a local paper. A premise that could have been funny ends up being slightly boring. Ariel tries to appear as a bad girl, using phrases like \"he ground my beef\", but ends up having to make up the dirtiest parts of her column. And then, when she gets notoriety, the way she wanted, she whines about it. I just couldn't really care about the character of Ariel at all.For a more entertaining, and less graphic, story about trying to make it in the big city and failed hopes, try reading \"In the Drink\" by Christiansen. As for this being \"the thinking person's Bridget Jones\" (yes, it says that on the back cover), I beg to disagree. These are very different books. Bridget is purely trying to entertain.

If he was going for Bowie-esque reinvention/trend-setting, he failed far worse than Bowie did during the same decade.Actually starts out pretty well with the funky stomp of \"Coming Up,\" the amusing \"Temporary Secretary,\" and the fun but empty blues ballad, \"On the Way,\" but the rest is about as spotty as it gets.

While several of these classic comedies are available on DVD, a few non-Columbia Stooge curios have turned up, including this title.SWING PARADE OF 1946 is a low-budget musical produced by the lowly Monogram Pictures, starring Gale Storm and Phil Regan, with Moe, Larry and Curly providing comedy relief. Away from their home studio, the boys seem to be a little disoriented; worse yet, Curly is clearly in declining health (later that year he suffered a stroke that forced him to drop out of the act). Rabid Stooge fans may want to check this one out, although it's nowhere near the level of their best work. Casual viewers in search of the usual boisterous antics are advised to look elsewhere.",

I think they traded resolution for brightness, and you can usually see the pictures from across the room, even at non-optimal angles. The resolutely-nontechie parents love them.

His songwriting is okay, but I think his playing shouldn't overshadow the song. The song should always come first.Many of his albums are lacking in the creativity department simply because he tries too hard to somehow inject his songs with an over usage of technique.

I have never been a fan of Romeo and Juliet (I think Hamlet is much better) but even I know the butchering of a classic play when I see one.

Even though it is set in the nineties, they still stick to the original script, even though half of it is cut for the sake of those who get tired of Shakespeare, (why they get tired of him, I don't know).Now I know that Hollywood has had some pretty bad follies before, but this film is beyond the area in which I draw the line. They should be ashamed of themselves. If you have to watch a version of ROMEO AND JULIET I'd highly reccomend either WEST SIDE STORY or the Franco Zefferelli version.",

The sellers obviously found out that Jong is teaching a confusing, misleading message, and no longer wanted to have any part of him or his teachings.Jong's premise is that it is essential to one's salvation and freedom from sin(s) that one believe that it was in His baptism by John that Jesus took (\"washed\") away and took on Himself the world's sins before finally carrying them to the cross. This \"water and Spirit\" baptism doctrine is a confused misreading of the New Testament. Neither the New Testament nor any of the Church Fathers taught this.In the guise of freeing his readers and followers from a \"works righteousness\" gospel, he instead burdens them with a quirky correct-belief-according-to-Paul-C.-Jong gospel.What other confused Christianities can we expect to come from the East?",

I wasn't sure i'd like the show but i'd heard about the movie so i decided to give the show a try. I really enjoyed it. I think those zombie things are freaky but they never really show much gore. I like all the characters each is very different. I thought the westerness of it was a nice suprise. I liked the people more in the show than in the movie because i got to know them more.I wish they could continue the show right where they left off. Stop reading reviews and get this show even if your only a little interested because you won't regret it.",

        "review": "Although there has been some films mentioning about UAV's (unmanned aerial vehicles), this one has the best coverage so far. The motivation dates back to U-2 flying over the Soviet sky. From the Cold War, Mid East conflicts, Vietnam War, Gulf War and Afghanistan, the experience leads to the evolution of UAV's and makes them more and more powerful and robust.Unlike the large-scale UAV's such as the Predator and Global Hawk, small-scale or even micro-scale UAV's also found their importance and are being developed. This is also an interesting part in this film.The content of this DVD is pretty thorough and comprehensive. After having watched it, I just feel it completely delightful and entertaining. Although I've already had certain understanding about UAV's, it is still an eye-opener for me.I have seen couple tech-related films by NOVA and found them well made. This one is no exception. For people who like military aircraft, this is the one you never should miss.",

I mean, when you mix Bill Cosby, Richard Prior, Walter Matthau, Michael Caine.....with this kind of an cast, you can't loose! It is good fun with a 70s kind of comic fun!

When we opened the gift it looked so neat, I could see the attraction, but I agree with all of those who have talked about the small black-and-white display with very poor resolution. The games are not nearly as good as those on the Leapster and the laptop is pretty large to take places. After a few minutes playing on his laptop, he always asks to play on my laptop. If anything, it has increased his desire to use my computer, and this is not good.We have a VTECH digital camera that is great - I'm surprised by how poor the graphics are on the Nitro Laptop. Even at that low price, the technology is at a point where they should be able to offer something better.",

The M-E-T-H-O-D Man has definitely went commercial....in other words he pulled what I call an \"Ice Cube\".Yall remember the \"old\" Ice Cube before all the movies and how nobody on the west couldn't touch him. Thats how Meth was, but sadly we may never see the \"old\" Meth again. On a good note #7 is str8 FIRE!!!!!! but too d*mn short. Buy this CD from a used CD joint....there are probably some at a used CD store already.",
